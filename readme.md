# FinanceCheck
Project developed for the Angular Workshop in IDA, WS 2019

## Idea
The Project should present the user selected information and graphs for selected stock prices.

## Features
1. login
2. saving of profile-relevant information( remembered company stocks, graph presets ... )
3. Displaying of data from the API (mostly textform, but graphs for stock history) 
4. Searching for data available through the API
   
## API
All external data will be gathered from the [IEX api](https://www.iexcloud.io/)

## UI Mockup
A rough html-mockup for the UI is located in the 'mockup' directory of this repo.
